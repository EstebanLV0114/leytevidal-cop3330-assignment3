Pseudocode for ex46 (wordFreq)

The program has two methods, main and Map<String, Integer> count.
The program starts by going to main where the input directory is found with the string containing the path
to the file. Then we use both the bufferedReader tool and FileReader tool to scan for words from the
input file that we store in an array list. Then we call the count method and pass the input list.
The count function that creates a map with the key as the word itself and the value
is the frequency of that word, then returns the map to main where we use Collections.sort() to sort both
the words and their frequency. It then uses for loops to print the word and its frequency in order from high to low.
