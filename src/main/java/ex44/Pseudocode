Pseudocode for ex44 (prodSearch)

This program uses an import called "com.google.gson.*" to pull values from the JSON file. The program
contains two methods, main and (int) checkJSON, the ladder having the parameters set to the product name and
the directory where the JSON file is. First the "Main" function is called where the directory
of the input file along with the prompted product name from the user are found.
The "Main" function uses a while loop that runs until the user enters
a valid product name present within the input file. When a name is found, the checkJSON method
uses a Gson and Reader tools, JsonElement and JsonObject to find the product within the JSON file.
The checkJSON uses a "try catch" approach and throw FileNotFoundException
to catch exceptions when reading from the JSON file will do 1 of 2 things. It will either print the product
and its characteristics when found along with returning 1, or it just returns 0 when the product is not found.
After returning 1 or 0, this value is checked in main method to either continue looping if it is 0,
otherwise the program ends.
